Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaConfig::Deep

This module serves as an experimental space for features I think the
core MetaConfig *should* provide, but in a state of uncertainty about
how they should be implemented.

The objective is to extract more metadata about plugins without plugins
having to percolate hand-written adjustments system-wide to get a useful
interface.

  Composition Data

This exposes data about the roles and parent classes, and their
respective versions in play on a given plugin, to give greater depth for
problem diagnosis.
