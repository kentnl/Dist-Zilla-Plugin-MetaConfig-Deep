Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaConfig::Deep

This module serves as an experimental space for features I think the
core MetaConfig *should* provide, but in a state of uncertainty about
how they should be implemented.

The objective is to extract more metadata about plugins without plugins
having to percolate hand-written adjustments system-wide to get a useful
interface.

  Composition Data

This exposes data about the roles and parent classes, and their
respective versions in play on a given plugin, to give greater depth for
problem diagnosis.

    {
      "class" : "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoPrereqs", 
      "name" : "@Author::KENTNL/AutoPrereqs", "version" : "5.041",
      "x_composes" : {
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::ConfigDumper"   : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser" : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::PPI"            : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin"         : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::PrereqSource"   : "5.041",
        "Moose::Object"                     : "2.1604"
      }
    }

@ETHER has already made excellent inroads into making this sort of
metadata exposed via exporting "version" in all "metaconfig" plugin's
she has access to, and this is an attempt at providing the same level of
insight without requiring so much explicit buy-in from plugin authors.

This also has the neat side effect of showing what phases a plug-in is
subscribed to.
