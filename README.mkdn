# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaConfig::Deep - Experimental enhancements to MetaConfig

# VERSION

version 0.001001

# DESCRIPTION

This module serves as an experimental space for features I think the core MetaConfig _should_
provide, but in a state of uncertainty about how they should be implemented.

The objective is to extract more metadata about plugins without plugins having to percolate
hand-written adjustments system-wide to get a useful interface.

## Composition Data

This exposes data about the roles and parent classes, and their respective versions in play
on a given plugin, to give greater depth for problem diagnosis.

    {
      "class" : "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Author::KENTNL::CONTRIBUTING",
      "config" : {...},
      "name" : "@Author::KENTNL/Author::KENTNL::CONTRIBUTING",
      "version" : "0.001005",
      "x_composes" : {
        "Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenerateFile::FromShareDir" : "0.009",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::AfterBuild"                   : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::AfterRelease"                 : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::ConfigDumper"                 : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer"                 : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::FileInjector"                 : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::FileMunger"                   : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin"                       : "5.041",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::RepoFileInjector"             : "0.005",
        "Dist::Zilla::Role::TextTemplate"                 : "5.041",
        "Moose::Object"                                   : "2.1604",
        "MooseX::SlurpyConstructor::Role::Object"         : "1.2"
      }
    }

`@ETHER` has already made excellent inroads into making this sort of metadata exposed
via exporting `version` in all `metaconfig` plugin's she has access to, and this is an attempt
at providing the same level of insight without requiring so much explicit buy-in from plugin authors.

This also has the neat side effect of showing what phases a plug-in is subscribed to.
